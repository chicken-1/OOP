## Introduction
This is a repository to save practical project of Course: INT2204-1 Object-oriented programming (OOP) at VNU University of Engineering and Technology, in the Spring Semester of 2024.

Our project includes developing a command line version and a graphic user interface (GUI) version of an English learning application with the following features:
- An English-Vietnamese file data for the personalized English-Vietnamese dictionary, from here one can add/remove/update any word. File includes English words and their Vietnamese meanings, parts of speech and phonetic transcriptions.
